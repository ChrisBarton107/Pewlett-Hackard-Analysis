## Summary<br>
- There are 90,398 roles that need to be filled due to retirement from the company
- With 1,549 eligible mentors, the company will struggle to mentor the next generation of employees. However, there are other factors involved in this process that could influence the success or failure but the current ratio of eligible mentors to roles needed filled is not promising. There is ambiguity in what is involved in the mentoring process and how much time and resources are devoted to mentoring a new employee
